# Colorization
A Python UI that allows for an end user to colourize old black and white images to RGB colour.

Due to GitHub limitations on file size imports, a necessary component of the program has been uploaded to a personal Google Drive. You must download it in order for the program to function.


To run this program: 

Please create a new folder and clone the repository in it. 

Download the .caffemodel file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cvU96oNoU0vxsTahucZaRL-4-kOXEv92/view?usp=sharing

Move the model file to the cloned repository and run the Python file.
